# Game of Throws: Technical and Functional Specification

## 1. Introduction

Game of Throws is a course project for network science and NoSQL databases classes that analyzes chess game data to identify patterns in player mistakes (blunders). The project will model chess blunders as a network using graph theory and implement the solution using Neo4j, a graph database.

This project demonstrates practical applications of network analysis concepts and NoSQL database technologies in analyzing real-world data.

## 2. Project Overview

### 2.1 Objective

The objective is to analyze chess game data to discover patterns in how players make mistakes during games. By representing blunders as a network, we can identify relationships between players, their common mistakes, and the chess openings where these mistakes occur.

### 2.2 Key Features

1. Create a graph database to store relationships between players, games, openings, and blunders
2. Identify "blunder communities" (groups of players who make similar mistakes)
3. Analyze "blunder cascades" (sequences of mistakes within games)
4. Rank chess openings by blunder frequency
5. Implement queries to explore blunder patterns

## 3. Dataset Description

The project will use a dataset from Lichess.org, available on Kaggle, containing over 20,000 chess games. Each game record includes:

- Game ID and metadata (Rated status, Start/End Time, Number of Turns, etc.)
- Player information (IDs and Ratings)
- Complete game moves in standard chess notation
- Opening information (ECO code, name, and ply count)

Since the dataset doesn't explicitly identify blunders, the project will use simple criteria to detect them, such as:
- Large evaluation drops (using a chess engine like Stockfish)
- Basic pattern recognition for common mistakes (hanging pieces, missed opportunities)

## 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1 Software Requirements

- Python 3.8+ for data processing and analysis
- Neo4j for graph database storage and querying
- Python libraries:
  - python-chess: For parsing chess games
  - Stockfish (simplified integration): For basic position evaluation
  - py2neo: For Neo4j integration
  - NetworkX: For network analysis
  - pandas: For data manipulation
  - matplotlib/seaborn: For basic visualization

### 4.2 Hardware Requirements

- Standard laptop/desktop with 8GB+ RAM
- Storage space for Neo4j database (10GB should be sufficient)

## 5. System Architecture

### 5.1 Components

1. **Data Processing Module**: Import and process chess game data
2. **Blunder Detection Module**: Identify blunders in chess games
3. **Graph Database**: Store the network of players, games, and blunders
4. **Analysis Module**: Perform network analysis on the blunder graph
5. **Visualization Module**: Create basic visualizations of results

### 5.2 Graph Schema

The Neo4j database will use a simplified schema:

**Nodes**:
- Player (properties: id, rating)
- Game (properties: id, result, time_control)
- Opening (properties: eco, name)
- Blunder (properties: type, position, evaluation_drop)

**Relationships**:
- (Player)-[PLAYED]->(Game)
- (Game)-[USED]->(Opening)
- (Player)-[MADE]->(Blunder)-[IN]->(Game)
- (Blunder)-[FOLLOWED]->(Blunder)

## 6. Functional Requirements

### 6.1 Data Processing

1. Import chess games from the dataset
2. Parse game moves to extract positions
3. Identify blunders using simplified criteria
4. Transform processed data for database import

### 6.2 Graph Database Implementation

1. Create Neo4j database with the defined schema
2. Import processed data into Neo4j
3. Implement basic queries for analysis

### 6.3 Analysis Features

1. **Blunder Community Detection**:
   - Group players based on similar blunder patterns
   - Visualize communities using network graphs

2. **Blunder Cascade Analysis**:
   - Identify sequences of blunders within games
   - Calculate basic statistics on blunder sequences

3. **Opening Analysis**:
   - Compare blunder frequencies across different openings
   - Identify specific positions where blunders are common

### 6.4 Visualization and Reporting

1. Generate basic network visualizations
2. Create charts showing key findings
3. Prepare a final report documenting the analysis and results

## 8. Deliverables

1. Source code for all project components
2. Neo4j database with imported chess data and blunder network
3. Documentation of queries and analyses
4. Visualizations of key findings
5. Final report summarizing the project and results

## 9. Limitations and Scope

To ensure the project is feasible within the 7-week timeframe, the following limitations will be applied:

1. Focus on a manageable subset of games if processing the entire dataset proves too time-consuming
2. Use simplified blunder detection rather than comprehensive chess engine analysis
3. Implement core network analysis techniques without extensive optimization
4. Create basic visualizations rather than interactive dashboards

## 10. Conclusion

The Blunder Co-Occurrence Network project applies network analysis and graph database concepts to chess data, providing insights into how players make mistakes. By focusing on a well-defined scope and using appropriate technologies, this project is feasible to complete within the 7-week timeframe while demonstrating key concepts from both network science and NoSQL database courses.
